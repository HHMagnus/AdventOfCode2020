# Solution to Advent of Code 2020 in C++
I originally started solving them in C++ in 2020 as I was starting my masters project in C++. I had never used C++ before and it seemed like a good way to learn the language. I ended up getting stuck on part 2 of day 20. However, I picked back up the last days and completed them in 2024.

To run the puzzles put the corresponding input into the same folder with the name "inpux.txt" and compile and run the file corresponding to the day.
